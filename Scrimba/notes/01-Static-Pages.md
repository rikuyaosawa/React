## First React Code

JSX:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>);
```

HTML:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

`createRoot(domNode, options?)` lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.

## React.createElement()

In the early days of React, they created a function called `createElement` which returns a regular JavaScript object with specific structure that makes sense to React.

JS:

```js
import { createElement } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
const reactElement = createElement("h1", null, "Hello from createElement!");

console.log(reactElement); // returns regular JS object

root.render(reactElement);
```

Console:

```js
{type: 'h1', key: null, props: {children: 'Hello from createElement!'}, _owner: null, _store: {}}
```

This code might not look that complicated, but once nested, things get difficult real quick.
And React team realized that, and created something different called **`JSX`**, which is the
first code you wrote earlier with the HTML looking syntax.

## JSX

JSX is simply what we call syntactic sugar on top of the `createElement` call. Under the hood, React is taking the JSX syntax and turning into calls to `createElement`.

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
const reactElement = <h1>Hello from JSX!</h1>;

console.log(reactElement);

root.render(reactElement);
```

## Why choose React?

- Highest job demand
- Largest ecosystem/community
- Less "magic"
- Composable/Declarative
- Active development

### Composable

React allows you to build complex user interfaces by combining smaller, reusable pieces called **components**. Its composability makes it easier to maintain and scale applications by encouraging the reuse of well-defined, modular pieces.

### Declarative

React is **declarative** because you describe what you want the UI to look like at any given time, and React takes care of managing the underlying updates to reflect that state. You donâ€™t need to imperatively manipulate the DOM; instead, you define the desired outcome, and React ensures the UI matches that state.

Here is a comparison between declarative and imperative:

Declarative ("What should be done"):

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>);
```

Imperative ("How should it be done"):

```js
const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "Hello, React!";
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1);
```

## Components

**Components** are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Example of function component:

```jsx
function Page() {
  return (
    <ol>
      <li>React is a popular library </li>
      <li>I am more likely to get a job</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

root.render(<Page />);
```

Notice we use **Pascal Case** to name the component function.

### Fragments

**React Fragments** are a lightweight way to group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node. They let you return multiple elements from a component or render function without wrapping them in a parent container like a `<div>`.

You can import them or directly type in like the following:

```jsx
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>This is a description.</p>
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

But there is a shorter and cleaner syntax using empty angle brackets:

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>This is a description.</p>
  </>
);
```

### Parent/Child Component

The function component `Page` is in this case the **"parent"** comnponent that has three separate **"child"** components. In a larger React app, this continues down the tree.

```jsx
function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Styling with Classes

JSX uses `className` to set class for styling a component.

The reason for that is because the DOM uses `className` syntax and JSX accesses the native DOM properties under the hood.

```jsx
<nav>
  <ul className="nav-list">
    <li>Pricing</li>
    <li>About</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Component as Module

It is pretty straightforward if you know how modules work in JavaScript.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        // ...
    );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

And import it where you want to use the module.

```jsx
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```

# Pop Quiz

1.  Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I
    call `root.render()`?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>All the elements I render get put inside the div with the id of "root" (or whatever other element I might select when calling createRoot)</details>
    <br />

2.  What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:

    ```jsx
    console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
    ```

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>An object! Unlike creating an HTML element in vanilla DOM JS, what gets created from the JSX we have in our React code is a plain JS object that React will use to fill in the view.</details>
    <br />

3.  What's wrong with this code:

    ```jsx
    root.render(
        <h1>Hi there</h1>
        <p>This is my website!</p>
    );
    ```

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>You can only render 1 parent element at a time. That parent element can have as many children elements as you want.</details>
    <br />

4.  What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>_Imperative_ means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a task.  _Declarative_ means we can write our code to simply "describe" _what_ should show up on the page and allow the rool (React, e.g.) to handle the details on _how_ to put those things on the page.</details>
    <br />

5.  What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.</details>
    <br />

6.  What is a React component?

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>A reusable bit of code that returns React elements. (UI)</details>
    <br />

7.  What's wrong with this code?

    ```jsx
    function myComponent() {
      return <small>I'm tiny text!</small>;
    }
    ```

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>The function name is not in pascal case.</details>
    <br />

8.  What's wrong with this code?

    ```jsx
    function Header() {
      return (
        <header>
          <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React logo" />
        </header>
      );
    }

    root.render(Header());
    ```

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>The Header component should be called using angle brackets.</details>
    <br />
