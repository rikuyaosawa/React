## First React Code

JSX:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>);
```

HTML:

```html
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

`createRoot(domNode, options?)` lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.

## React.createElement()

In the early days of React, they created a function called `createElement` which returns
a regular JavaScript object with specific structure that makes sense to React.

JS:

```js
import { createElement } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
const reactElement = createElement("h1", null, "Hello from createElement!");

console.log(reactElement); // returns regular JS object

root.render(reactElement);
```

Console:

```js
{type: 'h1', key: null, props: {children: 'Hello from createElement!'}, _owner: null, _store: {}}
```

This code might not look that complicated, but once nested, things get difficult real quick.
And React team realized that, and created something different called **`JSX`**, which is the
first code you wrote earlier with the HTML looking syntax.

## JSX

JSX is simply what we call syntactic sugar on top of the `createElement` call.
Under the hood, React is taking the JSX syntax and turning into calls to `createElement`.

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
const reactElement = <h1>Hello from JSX!</h1>;

console.log(reactElement);

root.render(reactElement);
```

## Why choose React?

-   Highest job demand
-   Largest ecosystem/community
-   Less "magic"
-   Composable/Declarative
-   Active development

### Composable

React allows you to build complex user interfaces by combining smaller, reusable pieces called **components**. Its composability makes it easier to maintain and scale applications by encouraging the reuse of well-defined, modular pieces.

### Declarative

React is **declarative** because you describe what you want the UI to look like at any given time, and React takes care of managing the underlying updates to reflect that state. You donâ€™t need to imperatively manipulate the DOM; instead, you define the desired outcome, and React ensures the UI matches that state.

Here is a comparison between declarative and imperative:

Declarative ("What should be done"):

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>);
```

Imperative ("How should it be done"):

```js
const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "Hello, React!";
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1);
```
